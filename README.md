## Latency and Fault Tolerance for Distributed System

![hystrix-image](<url> "Configuring Hystrix for effective Fault Tolerance")

## What isÂ Hystrix?
Hystrix is designed to do the following:
* Give protection from and control over latency and failure from dependencies accessed (typically over the network) via third-party client libraries.
* Stop cascading failures in a complex distributed system.
* Fail fast and rapidly recover.
* Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.
* Enable near real-time monitoring, alerting, and operational control.

In simple terms, it isolates external dependencies so that one may not affect the other.

**With great decentralization comes a great need of resilient fault tolerance. As Netflix says, fault tolerance is not a feature, it's a requirement.**

Refer to the [Latency and Fault Tolerance for Distributed System - Configuring Hystrix for effective Fault Tolerance](<url>) for details.
